A writeup that clearly describes your admissible heuristic function â„Ž3 employed to solve
the 8-puzzle optimally when single moves and double moves are all considered. Include
your reasoning why the function is admissible

This h3 function accounts for the program using double moves.
It backs on the idea of using the Manhattan distance heuristic,
but lowers the cost of using double moves.
To do this, the h-function subtracts 1 for the cost when a possible double
move is found.

To locate these double moves, the algorithm checks for two adjacent cells which are not in
their goal location.

This heuristic is admissible because it does not overestimate the cost of a move.
How? This is because when double moves are possible, a cell will never be more than it's
(modified) Manhattan distance from its goal.
